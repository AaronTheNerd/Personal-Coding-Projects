# Aaron Barge's Personal Coding Projects

This is where I get to work on my programming skills and show them to the world.
Obviously, my main language is currently C++.
However, I am trying to branch out into MatLab and Python.
Maybe some C# or SQL on the way.

Feel free to contact me about any comments, possible improvements, or errors.
I hope you enjoy your stay.
